# jak-bio tools

This is a collection of miscellaneous scripts (mostly python 3) for working with various data types. These weren't initially intended to share, so there may be hard-coded paths or weird dependencies not explicitly mentioned. They may also be horribly coded or incredibly inefficient, but suit the needs they were intended for.
